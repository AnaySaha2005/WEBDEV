        <h2>Publication history</h2>
        <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books,
            <br>
            Marvel set about creating new superhero characters.
            During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man. <br>
            Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of  readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him". <br>
            Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory. <br>
            The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War <br>
             Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".

            As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes <br>
             The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover. <br>
             Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", was in Tales of Suspense #39,<br>
              released in December 1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964, the science-fiction and horror stories were removed entirely, with the series running only Iron Man and Captain America stories.</p>
